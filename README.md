## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**RoanKoan/RoanKoan** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on video games as a producer
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently getting a handle on python (a smidge)
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on games, immersive experiences, and anything where story and technology intersect. 
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with all sorts of initiatives. 
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about how Season 8 of GoT went so horribly wrong. 
- ğŸ“« How to reach me...telepathy or lucid dreaming. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like concerts and good Japanese whiskey
